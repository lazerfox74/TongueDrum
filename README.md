<!-- Describe your example here -->

A capacitive touch playing surface comprised of 6 copper washers with series resistors running into the rasberry pi pico for the touch interface with 6 leds for visual feedback. Touch data sent to a Daisy Seed Microcontroller via DMA SPI communication where audio generation algorithms are performed. 6 potentiometers as synthesis and tuning controlls housed a 3d printed enclosure.

jtouch library used for the capacitive touch sensing developed by james brown.
